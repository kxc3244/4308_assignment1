Java
----------------------------

Code is structured as one whole file named find_route.java with Node classes for each individual city that are organized around the nodes to find the optimal path. The code is divided for two parts, uninformed and informed search paths. 

----------------------------

How to run the code using linux terminal example:

javac find_route.java
java find_route input1.txt Bremen Kassel

-----------------------------

Notes:

- Informed search is still a little buggy!!
- The code is documented with java doc to explain the functionality if need be
